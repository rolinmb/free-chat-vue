Made with Google Firebase, Vercel and Vue

TODO: firebase google auth is not functioning as expected, may have to manually add users by email and password for now
(maybe try using import firebase from 'firebase' and firebase.auth().... to call the firebase api)

npm run serve to test

npm run build to prepare for firebase hosting
